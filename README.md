## Additional Prerequisites
This workshop was designed for inviduals with an intermediate level of experience in QuPath and Python-based data visualization. As such, you'll need to be familiar with installing extensions in QuPath and libraries in Python. Below are some relevant links towards setting up the environment of this pipeline:
- QuPath 0.3.2: https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/tag/v0.3.2
- Anaconda (for Spyder, a Python IDE): https://www.anaconda.com/
- StarDist setup in QuPath: https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/advanced/stardist.html
- Universal StarDist for QuPath (somewhat of a more user-friendly manner of using IF-trained StarDist models to segment mIHC data): https://github.com/MarkZaidi/Universal-StarDist-for-QuPath
